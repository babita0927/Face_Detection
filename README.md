# Face Detection using OpenCV
This project is a simple implementation of face detection using OpenCV in Python. It uses Haar Cascades, which is a popular machine learning-based approach for detecting objects in images.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
OpenCV 4.7.0 or later
Streamlit (for deployment)
## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/babita0927/Face_Detection
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Run the application locally: python app.py
Click on the "Can I detect your face?" button to start the webcam.
The application will detect faces in real-time using the webcam.
## Deployment
Install Streamlit: pip install streamlit
Run the application using Streamlit: streamlit run Streamlit_cam.py
